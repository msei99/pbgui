    Take Profit (TP) prices are linearly spaced between:

        pos_price * (1 - markup_start) to pos_price * (1 - markup_end) for short.
    The TP direction depends on the relative values of markup_start and markup_end:
        If markup_start > markup_end: TP grid is built backwards (starting at higher price and descending for long / ascending for short).
        If markup_start < markup_end: TP grid is built forwards (starting at lower price and ascending for long / descending for short).
    Example (long, backwards TP): If pos_price = 100, markup_start = 0.01, markup_end = 0.005, and close_grid_qty_pct = 0.2, TP prices are: [101.0, 100.9, 100.8, 100.7, 100.6].
    Example (long, forwards TP): If markup_start = 0.005, markup_end = 0.01, TP prices are: [100.5, 100.6, 100.7, 100.8, 100.9].
    Example (short, forwards TP): If pos_price = 100, markup_start = 0.005, markup_end = 0.01, TP prices are: [99.5, 99.4, 99.3, 99.2, 99.1].
    Example (short, backwards TP): If markup_start = 0.01, markup_end = 0.005, TP prices are: [99.0, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4].
    Quantity per order is full pos size * close_grid_qty_pct.
    Note: Full position size refers to the maxed-out size. If the actual position is smaller, fewer than 1 / close_grid_qty_pct orders may be created.
    The TP grid is filled in order from markup_start to markup_end, allocating each slice up to the respective quantity:
        First TP up to close_grid_qty_pct * full_pos_size.
        Second TP from close_grid_qty_pct to 2 * close_grid_qty_pct, etc.
    Example: If full_pos_size = 100 and long_pos_size = 55, and prices are built backwards, then TP orders might be [15@100.8, 20@100.9, 20@101.0].
    If position exceeds full position size, excess size is added to the TP order closest to markup_start.
        Example: If long_pos_size = 130 and grid is forwards, TP orders are [50@100.5, 20@100.6, 20@100.7, 20@100.8, 20@100.9].
