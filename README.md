## Requirements
- Python 3.8.x and higher
- Streamlit 1.26.0 and higher
- Linux and Winodws (Run Module not supported)
- Live Modul only tested on bybit and bitget

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/msei99/pbgui.git
cd pbgui
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running
```
streamlit run pbgui.py

```
Open http://localhost:8501 with Browser\
Password = PBGui$Bot!\
Change Password in file: .streamlit/secrets.toml\
On First Run, you have to select your passivbot directory

## PBRun Instance Manager
To enable the PBGui instance manager in the GUI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the PBGui interface.
2. Go to Live and enable PBRun

To ensure that the Instance Manager starts after rebooting your server, you can use the following method:

1. Create a script file, such as "start.sh", in your pbgui directory (e.g., ~/software/pbgui).
2. In the script file, include the following lines:

```
#!/usr/bin/bash
venv=~/software/pb_env # Path to your Python virtual environment
pbgui=~/software/pbgui # Path to your PBGui installation

source ${venv}/bin/activate
cd ${pbgui}
python PBRun.py &
```

3. Save the script file and make it executable by running the command: `chmod 755 start.sh`.
4. Open your crontab file by running the command: `crontab -e`.
5. Add the following line to the crontab file to execute the script at reboot:

```
@reboot ~/software/pbgui/start.sh
```

6. Save the crontab file.

Please make sure to adjust the paths in the script file and crontab entry according to your specific setup.

## PBStat Statistics
Actually, the best way to enable PBStat is by adding the following line to your start.sh script:
```
python PBStat.py &
```
This command will run the PBStat.py script in the background, allowing it to collect statistics.

## PBData Databank for Dashboard
Actually, the best way to enable PBData is by adding the following line to your start.sh script:
```
python PBData.py &
```
This command will run the PBData.py in the background and filling the database for the dashboard

## PBRemote Server Manager
With PBRemote, you can efficiently manage passivbot instances on multiple servers directly from your PC.
This includes starting, stopping, removing, and syncing instances from and to your servers.
PBRemote utilizes rclone to establish communication via cloud storage with your servers.
The advantage is that you do not need to open any incoming firewall ports on your PC or servers.
Additionally, all your passivbot config data is securely transferred and stored on your preferred cloud storage provider.
rclone supports over 70 cloud storage providers, you can find more information at https://rclone.org/.
To install rclone, you can use the following command:
```
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```
As a recommendation, Synology C2 Object Storage offers a reliable option.
They provide 15GB of free storage, and you can sign up at https://c2.synology.com/en-uk/object-storage/overview.
After registration, create your bucket using your own unique name. Please note that using "pbgui" as a bucket name will not work, as it has already been chosen by me. Configure rclone on your PC and servers by following the steps below:
Rclone configuration (Synology):
```
rclone config create <bucket_name> s3 provider=Synology region=eu-002 endpoint=eu-002.s3.synologyc2.net no_check_bucket=true access_key_id=<key> secret_access_key=<secret>
```
You need to configure pbgui.ini with a minimum of this settings on your VPS.
Example pbgui.ini (replace parameters with your own correct settings).
```
[main]
pbdir = /home/mani/software/passivbot
pbname = manibot50
[pbremote]
bucket = pbgui:
```
There is no need to install or run streamlit on your Remote Server.
Start PBRun.py and PBRemote using the start.sh script.

## PBShare Data Sharing Manager
With PBShare, you can generate Live Grid pictures and upload them to imagekit.io.
On every instance, you have the option to enable the Live Grid feature.
Within the Services section of PBShare, you can download an index.html file that can be placed on your web server for sharing purposes.
To utilize this service, you will need to create a free ImageKit account.
For uploading the pictures to ImageKit, rclone is used.
To set up rclone, use the following command:
```
rclone config create <name> imagekit endpoint=<url_endpoint> public_key=<public_key> private_key=<private_key>
```

## Running on Windows
Copy the start.bat.example to start.bat
Edit pbguipath in the start.bat to your pbgui installation path
Add start.bat to Windows Task Scheduler and use Trigger "At system startup"
