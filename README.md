### Overview
Passivbot GUI (pbgui) is a WEB Interface for Passivbot programed in python with streamlit

It has the following functions:
- Running, backtesting, and optimization Passivbot v7 and v6 (single and multi).
- Installing Passivbot configurations on your VPS.
- Starting and stopping Passivbot instances on your VPS.
- Moving instances between your VPS.
- Monitoring your instances and restarting them if they crash.
- A dashboard for viewing trading performance.
- An interface to CoinMarketCap for selecting and filtering coins.
- Installing and updating your VPS with just a few clicks.
- And much more to easily manage Passivbot.

### Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Streamlit 1.40.0
- Linux

### Recommendation

- Master Server: Linux with 32GB of memory and 8 CPUs.
- VPS for Running Passivbot: Minimum specifications of 1 CPU, 1GB Memory, and 10GB SSD.

### Get your VPS for running passivbot

I recommend the provider IONOS, as their smallest VPS plan is available for only 1 Euro \
I have been using their services for over a year without any outages \
Please use my [referral link](https://aklam.io/esMFvG) to obtain a VPS from IONOS \
A good alternative is a VPS from Contabo. Please use my [referral link](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-101296145-12454592)

## Installation

### Ubuntu installer

There is a install.sh for Ubuntu. Working on Ubuntu 24.04
```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msei99/pbgui/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual installation for all Linux distributions

Clone pbgui and passivbot v6 and v7
```
git clone https://github.com/msei99/pbgui.git
git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git pb6
git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git pb7
```
Create needed venv's
```
python3.10 -m venv venv_pbgui
python3.10 -m venv venv_pb6
python3.10 -m venv venv_pb7
```
Install requirements for pb6, pb7 and pbgui
```
source venv_pb6/bin/activate
cd pb6
git checkout v6.1.4b
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
cd ..
source venv_pb7/bin/activate
cd pb7
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd passivbot-rust/
sudo apt-get install rustc
sudo apt-get install cargo
maturin develop --release
deactivate
cd ../..
source venv_pbgui/bin/activate
cd pbgui
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Docker (Any OS)
Want to use **Docker** instead? Follow this [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/LeonSpors/passivbot-docker).

## Running
```
streamlit run pbgui.py

```
Open http://localhost:8501 with Browser\
Password = PBGui$Bot!\
Change Password in file: .streamlit/secrets.toml\
On First Run, you have to select your passivbot and venv directories
For the venv you have to enter the full path to python.
Example path for venv_pb7: /home/mani/software/venv_pb7/bin/python
Select Master on Welcome Screen if this System is used to send configs to VPS

## PBRun Instance Manager
To enable the PBGui instance manager in the GUI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the PBGui interface.
2. Go to Services and enable PBRun

To ensure that the Instance Manager starts after rebooting your server, you can use the following method:

1. Create a script file, such as "start.sh", in your pbgui directory (e.g., ~/software/pbgui).
2. In the script file, include the following lines:

```
#!/usr/bin/bash
venv=~/software/pb_env # Path to your Python virtual environment
pbgui=~/software/pbgui # Path to your PBGui installation

source ${venv}/bin/activate
cd ${pbgui}
python PBRun.py &
```

3. Save the script file and make it executable by running the command: `chmod 755 start.sh`.
4. Open your crontab file by running the command: `crontab -e`.
5. Add the following line to the crontab file to execute the script at reboot:

```
@reboot ~/software/pbgui/start.sh
```

6. Save the crontab file.

Please make sure to adjust the paths in the script file and crontab entry according to your specific setup.

## PBStat Statistics
This is only needed if you trade spot and have some statistics
Actually, the best way to enable PBStat is by adding the following line to your start.sh script:
```
python PBStat.py &
```
This command will run the PBStat.py script in the background, allowing it to collect statistics.

## PBData Database for Dashboard
Actually, the best way to enable PBData is by adding the following line to your start.sh script:
```
python PBData.py &
```
This command will run the PBData.py in the background and filling the database for the dashboard

## PBRemote Server Manager
You can install rclone and configure bucket using PBGui. Go to Services/PBRemote/Show Details.

With PBRemote, you can efficiently manage passivbot instances on multiple servers directly from your PC.
This includes starting, stopping, removing, and syncing instances from and to your servers.
PBRemote utilizes rclone to establish communication via cloud storage with your servers.
The advantage is that you do not need to open any incoming firewall ports on your PC or servers.
Additionally, all your passivbot config data is securely transferred and stored on your preferred cloud storage provider.
rclone supports over 70 cloud storage providers, you can find more information at https://rclone.org/.
Manual install rclone, you can use the following command:
```
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```
As a recommendation, Synology C2 Object Storage offers a reliable option.
They provide 15GB of free storage, and you can sign up at https://c2.synology.com/en-uk/object-storage/overview.
After registration, create your bucket using your own unique name. Please note that using "pbgui" as a bucket name will not work, as it has already been chosen by me.
Or do a manual Setup:
Configure rclone on your PC and servers by following the steps below:
Manual Rclone configuration (Synology):
```
rclone config create <bucket_name> s3 provider=Synology region=eu-002 endpoint=eu-002.s3.synologyc2.net no_check_bucket=true access_key_id=<key> secret_access_key=<secret>
```
You need to configure pbgui.ini with a minimum of this settings on your VPS.
Example pbgui.ini (replace parameters with your own correct settings).
```
[main]
pbdir = /home/mani/software/pb6
pbvenv = /home/mani/software/venv_pb6/bin/python
pb7dir = /home/mani/software/pb7
pb7venv = /home/mani/software/venv_pb7/bin/python
pbname = manibot50
[pbremote]
bucket = pbgui:
```
There is no need to install or run streamlit on your Remote Server.
Start PBRun.py and PBRemote using the start.sh script.

## PBCoinData CoinMarketCap Filters
With PBCoinData, you can download CoinMarketCap data for symbols and use this data to maintain your ignored_symbols and ignored_coins. You can filter out low market cap symbols or use vol/mcap to detect possible rug pulls early.

You need to configure the pbgui.ini file with a minimum of the following settings on your VPS. Here is an example of pbgui.ini (replace the parameters with your own correct settings):
```
[coinmarketcap]
api_key = <your_api_key>
fetch_limit = 1000
fetch_interval = 4
```
With these settings, PBCoinData will fetch the top 1000 symbols every 4 hours. You will need around 930 credits per month with this configuration. A Basic Free Plan from CoinMarketCap provides 10,000 credits per month, allowing you to run 1 master and 9 VPS instances with the same API key.
Start PBCoinData.py using the start.sh script.

## Running on Windows (Not tested with passivbot 7)
Copy the start.bat.example to start.bat
Edit pbguipath in the start.bat to your pbgui installation path
Add start.bat to Windows Task Scheduler and use Trigger "At system startup"
