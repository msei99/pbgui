## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Streamlit 1.38.0
- Linux or Winodws (Windows not tested on passivbot v7)

## Installation
Clone pbgui and passivbot v6 and v7
```
git clone https://github.com/msei99/pbgui.git
git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git pb6
git clone https://github.com/enarjord/passivbot.git pb7
```
Create needed venv's
```
python3 -m venv venv_pbgui
python3 -m venv venv_pb6
python3 -m venv venv_pb7
```
Install requirements for pb6, pb7 and pbgui
```
source venv_pb6/bin/activate
cd pb6
git checkout v6.1.4b
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
cd ..
source venv_pb7/bin/activate
cd pb7
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd passivbot-rust/
sudo apt-get install rustc
sudo apt-get install cargo
maturin develop --release
deactivate
cd ..
source venv_pbgui/bin/activate
cd pbgui
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running
```
streamlit run pbgui.py

```
Open http://localhost:8501 with Browser\
Password = PBGui$Bot!\
Change Password in file: .streamlit/secrets.toml\
On First Run, you have to select your passivbot and venv directories

## PBRun Instance Manager
To enable the PBGui instance manager in the GUI, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the PBGui interface.
2. Go to Services and enable PBRun

To ensure that the Instance Manager starts after rebooting your server, you can use the following method:

1. Create a script file, such as "start.sh", in your pbgui directory (e.g., ~/software/pbgui).
2. In the script file, include the following lines:

```
#!/usr/bin/bash
venv=~/software/pb_env # Path to your Python virtual environment
pbgui=~/software/pbgui # Path to your PBGui installation

source ${venv}/bin/activate
cd ${pbgui}
python PBRun.py &
```

3. Save the script file and make it executable by running the command: `chmod 755 start.sh`.
4. Open your crontab file by running the command: `crontab -e`.
5. Add the following line to the crontab file to execute the script at reboot:

```
@reboot ~/software/pbgui/start.sh
```

6. Save the crontab file.

Please make sure to adjust the paths in the script file and crontab entry according to your specific setup.

## PBStat Statistics
This is only needed if you trade spot and have some statistics
Actually, the best way to enable PBStat is by adding the following line to your start.sh script:
```
python PBStat.py &
```
This command will run the PBStat.py script in the background, allowing it to collect statistics.

## PBData Database for Dashboard
Actually, the best way to enable PBData is by adding the following line to your start.sh script:
```
python PBData.py &
```
This command will run the PBData.py in the background and filling the database for the dashboard

## PBRemote Server Manager
With PBRemote, you can efficiently manage passivbot instances on multiple servers directly from your PC.
This includes starting, stopping, removing, and syncing instances from and to your servers.
PBRemote utilizes rclone to establish communication via cloud storage with your servers.
The advantage is that you do not need to open any incoming firewall ports on your PC or servers.
Additionally, all your passivbot config data is securely transferred and stored on your preferred cloud storage provider.
rclone supports over 70 cloud storage providers, you can find more information at https://rclone.org/.
To install rclone, you can use the following command:
```
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```
As a recommendation, Synology C2 Object Storage offers a reliable option.
They provide 15GB of free storage, and you can sign up at https://c2.synology.com/en-uk/object-storage/overview.
After registration, create your bucket using your own unique name. Please note that using "pbgui" as a bucket name will not work, as it has already been chosen by me. Configure rclone on your PC and servers by following the steps below:
Rclone configuration (Synology):
```
rclone config create <bucket_name> s3 provider=Synology region=eu-002 endpoint=eu-002.s3.synologyc2.net no_check_bucket=true access_key_id=<key> secret_access_key=<secret>
```
You need to configure pbgui.ini with a minimum of this settings on your VPS.
Example pbgui.ini (replace parameters with your own correct settings).
```
[main]
pbdir = /home/mani/software/pb6
pbvenv = /home/mani/software/venv_pb6/bin/python
pb7dir = /home/mani/software/pb7
pb7venv = /home/mani/software/venv_pb7/bin/python
pbname = manibot50
[pbremote]
bucket = pbgui:
```
There is no need to install or run streamlit on your Remote Server.
Start PBRun.py and PBRemote using the start.sh script.

## Running on Windows (Not tested with passivbot 7)
Copy the start.bat.example to start.bat
Edit pbguipath in the start.bat to your pbgui installation path
Add start.bat to Windows Task Scheduler and use Trigger "At system startup"
